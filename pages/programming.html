                    <p>
                        I made this website as a fun project about myself. It
                        is a pure mix of HTML/CSS with your average bootstrap 
                        components. Below this section, I added another which
                        I am currently working on so you can see some of the magic
                        happen. Check back later to see changes!

                        I am currently developing a mod packager for <a href="https://thunderstore.io">Thunderstore</a>,
                        all you have to do is let the program do the work. From installing, to auto-filling information, 
                        to zipping and formatting your mod's name, it will do it all. However, this only works for Windows.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can find the download for ThunderPacker <a href="https://hard-bullet.thunderstore.io/package/dado/ThunderPacker/">here</a>, 
                        although I doubt you would have any use for it.

                    <p>
                        A long time ago I wanted to get into modding games, but I never had an idea of how to, until recently.
                        Hard Bullet's modding community, while small, has made a great number of mods which add content to the game,
                        or adjust already existing content. I happen to be one of the 4 main programmers making mods.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        All of the mods I have made can be found from <a href="https://hard-bullet.thunderstore.io/package/dado/">my profile</a>, 
                        beware the game is.. quite gory.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        You can find all of the other mods created by people on the <a href="https://hard-bullet.thunderstore.io/">Thunderstore page</a>, 
                        I would recommend taking a look at it. Just know that none of us are graphic designers.

                    <h3>Project: Termoculus</h3>
                    <p>
                        Oculus has always required its software to be open, within reason, when your VR headset is on. But whenever you turn it off,
                        the software is still running, and constantly trying to re-launch itself when closed via task manager. There are other software
                        solutions for this, but I was too lazy to deal with downloading those.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Instead, I made a program called 'Termoculus' which simply closes all 4 parts of the program at the same time. However, this is
                        a personal program which I don't intent on releasing.
