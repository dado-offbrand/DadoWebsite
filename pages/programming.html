                        I have a robotic quadruped based off of a Thingiverse
                        design, except I plan to program it myself. It is currently
                        fully assembled and ready for some programming and calibration
                        for the servos.

                        I made this website as a fun project about myself. It

                        I am currently working on so you can see some of the magic
                        happen. Check back later to see changes!

                        I am currently developing a mod packager for <a href="https://thunderstore.io" target="_blank">Thunderstore</a>,
                        all you have to do is let the program do the work. From installing, to auto-filling information, 
                        to zipping and formatting your mod's name, it will do it all. However, this only works for Windows.

                        although I doubt you would have any use for it.

                    <p>
                        A long time ago I wanted to get into modding games, but I never had an idea of how to, until recently.
                        Hard Bullet's modding community, while small, has made a great number of mods which add content to the game,
                        or adjust already existing content. I happen to be one of the 4 main programmers making mods.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        All of the mods I have made can be found from <a href="https://hard-bullet.thunderstore.io/package/dado/" target="_blank">my profile</a>, 
                        beware the game is.. quite gory.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        You can find all of the other mods created by people on the <a href="https://hard-bullet.thunderstore.io/" target="_blank">Thunderstore page</a>, 
                        I would recommend taking a look at it. Just know that none of us are graphic designers.

                    <h3>Project: Termoculus</h3>
                    <p>
                        Oculus has always required its software to be open, within reason, when your VR headset is on. But whenever you turn it off,
                        the software is still running, and constantly trying to re-launch itself when closed via task manager. There are other software
                        solutions for this, but I was too lazy to deal with downloading those.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Instead, I made a program called 'Termoculus' which simply closes all 4 parts of the program at the same time. However, this is
                        a personal program which I don't intent on releasing.

                    <p>
                        qStart was just a quick program used for starting certain applications in certain scenarios. For instance, Spotify, Visual Studio, and Chrome for coding.
                        It lets you add paths to a text file from the application, and then lets you save/close the file. From there, just press start and it will start everything
                        for you. Quicker than launching all 3, for the most part.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Currently there is no download for the application as I dropped it for a long while until recently, and I want to redo the whole application.
